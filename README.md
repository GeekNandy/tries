Tries

Implementation of R-Way Tries

The API shows the implementation of String Symbol Table using R-Way Trie data structure.The API currently supports  operations like
SpellChecker,Prefix Matching,WildCard Matching,Longest Prefix Matching(T9 Dictionary).
Major problem with the R-Way Tries is its memory usage.At each node it uses memory equivalent to array of length R.To improve
the memory usage Ternary Search Tries is implemented.At every node it has only three branches.

I am looking forward for the implementation of Suffix Trees,Other Advanced Data Structures and many more operations that could be added to this API.
Any support, help or suggestions on improvement are most welcome.
