Implementation of R-Way Tries

The API shows the implementation of String Symbol Table using R-Way Trie data structure.The API currently supports  operations like
SpellChecker,Prefix Matching,WildCard Matching,Longest Prefix Matching(T9 Dictionary).
Major problem with the R-Way Tries is its memory usage.At each node it uses memory equivalent to array of length R.To improve
the memory usage Ternary Search Tries is implemented.At every node it has only three branches.

I am looking forward for the implementation of Suffix Trees,Other Advanced Data Structures and many more operations that could be added to this API.
Any support, help or suggestions on improvement are most welcome.

This implementation contains a folder ADT.It contains several Generic Data Structures like Stack,Queues, Priority Queues.

Finally there are various Compression algorithms.We have used
here various abstractions for making Programming a lot easier.
We have used here BinaryStdIn(Takes Input Stream in Binary Format),BinaryStdOut(Outputs the Binary Stream),HexDump,BinaryDump,and PictureDump.

Using this standard files,we have implemented various compression algorithms like FixedLengthEncoding,Running Length Encoding,Huffman Compression,LZW Compression.
